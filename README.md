## Notes

- `Astro.glob()` to access data from files in your project
- `getStaticPaths()` to create multiple pages (routes) at once
If you need information to construct the page routes, write it inside `getStaticPaths()`

To receive information in the HTML template of a page route, write it outside `getStaticPaths()`
