Hey friends,

This is the first entry and behind the scenes look into my experimentation with A-Frame. My intent is to turn it into a fully featured site which will be used to document my journey as I build little projects and prototypes.

Unlike most of my other projects, I'm hoping to finish this one and share my progress publicly. As of now, there isn't much to the site besides this entry and <a href="/a-frame/sketch/01-hello-world">a page</a> demoing a-frame's equivalent of "hello world".

## Inspiration

The current list of people I am heavily inspired by to take on this project:

- [goodenough.us](https://goodenough.us/)
- [hundredrabbits](100r.co)
- [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/)
- [udara.io](https://udara.io/)

## Experience (or lack of)

I've played around with A-Frame and ThreeJS many years ago, but I never properly spent the time to figure it out.

Here are some things I made in the past:

- [Colour a Revit model - A-Frame](https://emilyyleung.github.io/revit_obj_170821/)
- [Minecraft Cube - ThreeJS](https://emilyyleung.github.io/minecraft_cube/)
- [Moon Space - ThreeJS](https://emilyyleung.github.io/moon_space/)
