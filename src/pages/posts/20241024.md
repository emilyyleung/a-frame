# Hello World

Hey friends,

This is the first entry and behind the scenes look into my experimentation with A-Frame. My intent is to turn it into a fully featured site which will be used to document my journey as I build little projects and prototypes.

Unlike most of my other projects, I'm hoping to finish this one and share my progress publicly. As of now, there isn't much to the site besides this entry and a page demoing a-frame's equivalent of "hello world".

## Inspiration

The current list of people I am heavily inspired by to take on this project:

- [goodenough.us](https://goodenough.us/)
- [hundredrabbits](100r.co)
- [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/)
- [udara.io](https://udara.io/)

# Todo List

- [x] Create Github repo called "a-frame"
- [x] Create new Astro project and install Shadcn/ui
  - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/astro
- [x] Add new page /demo and test whether A-Frame can work in an Astro layout
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77674937/is-there-a-way-to-integrate-a-frame-into-astro
  - Not sure whether this inline tag was necessary (as it works the same locally without it)
- [x] Add dark mode through Shadcn/ui
  - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/dark-mode/astro
- [ ] Write a post covering the background and progress of the site so far
- [ ] Deploy to Github Pages
