I went outside for a walk yesterday and managed to find a cool spot to capture a photosphere.

Still trying to work out the kinks of capturing this type of image, but otherwise I'd say it's pretty good. After I'd taken the photosphere, my camera also tried to blend in the parts of the image that I'd missed.
